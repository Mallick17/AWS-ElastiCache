    port=6379,
    ssl=True
)
r.set('mykey', 'Hello, ElastiCache!')
print(r.get('mykey'))
```

### Basic Commands After Connecting

### Example Metrics (Sample 16 out of 39)

| Metric Name              | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPUUtilization**       | Percentage of CPU used by the node. High usage may indicate processing bottlenecks. |
| **FreeableMemory**       | Amount of unused memory available. Low value signals memory pressure.               |
| **BytesUsedForCache**    | Total memory currently being used for cached data.                                  |
| **CurrConnections**      | Number of client connections currently open.                                        |
| **CacheHits**            | Number of successful key retrievals. High value indicates effective caching.        |
| **CacheMisses**          | Number of failed retrievals. High value suggests caching inefficiency.              |
| **Evictions**            | Count of keys evicted due to memory limits. Should be minimized.                    |
| **ReplicationLag**       | Delay between primary and replica sync. High values could lead to stale reads.      |
| **NetworkBytesIn/Out**   | Volume of data transferred in and out of the node.                                  |
| **CurrItems**            | Number of items currently in the cache.                                             |
| **SwapUsage**            | Amount of disk swap used. Should be ideally zero for in-memory databases.           |
| **Latency**              | Time taken to respond to client requests.                                           |
| **EngineCPUUtilization** | CPU usage specifically by the Redis engine.                                         |

| **ClientConnections**    | Active connections to the cache from applications.                                  |
| **CommandRate**          | Rate of Redis commands processed per second.                                        |

### Example Use Case:

* You observe high `CacheMisses` and low `CacheHits`: You might need to increase your cache size or adjust TTLs.
* Increasing `Evictions` may indicate your working set is too large for the current node size.
* Monitoring `ReplicationLag` is critical in read-replica environments to avoid stale data.

Metrics can be visualized in CloudWatch dashboards or used with alarms and AWS Lambda automation for self-healing workflows.

**Example Use Case:**
Enable slow logs and set the threshold to `1000` microseconds to log all commands taking over 1ms. This helps pinpoint inefficient queries like `SMEMBERS large-set`.

</details>

### Engine Logs
* **What it is:** Captures engine-level events like restarts, connection failures, and internal errors.
* **Why used:** Useful for operational monitoring and debugging.
* **Advantages:** Can help detect crashes, restart causes, and memory failures.

| **Log error message**    | Describes any errors encountered during log delivery. Example: `Access denied to CloudWatch Logs.` |

**Example Use Case:**
Enable engine logs and route them to CloudWatch Logs to monitor for out-of-memory errors or failed snapshot saves (`RDB save failed`), and configure CloudWatch Alarms to alert operations teams.

These logs are essential for maintaining visibility into cache performance and health. Enable them via the AWS Console or CLI depending on your operational requirements.

## Maintenance and Backups

### Maintenance

* **Maintenance Window:** Scheduled weekly maintenance is set for `Sunday 18:30 - Sunday 19:30 UTC`. During this window, AWS may apply critical updates.
* **Auto Upgrade Minor Versions:** *Disabled*. This means that patch-level updates (e.g., from 7.0.1 to 7.0.2) won't be automatically applied.
* **Notification ARN:** *Disabled*. No Amazon SNS notification target is configured for maintenance-related alerts.

**Example Use Case:**
If you want to be alerted before any maintenance actions, set up an SNS topic and subscribe your email to receive notifications by configuring the Notification ARN.

### Backup

* **Automatic Backups:** *Disabled*. No daily backups are currently configured.
* **Backup Retention Period:** `0 days`. Since automated backups are disabled, retention is not applicable.
* **Backup Window:** `23:30-00:30 UTC`. If enabled, automated backups would be taken during this window.

### Backups Table

| Column          | Description                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backup Name** | The name assigned to the backup. E.g., `rt-redis-backup-2025-07-30-23-30`.   |
| **Backup Type** | Indicates if the backup is automatic or manual. E.g., `automated`, `manual`. |
| **Status**      | Current state of the backup. E.g., `available`, `creating`, `failed`.        |
| **Cache Size**  | The total memory used by the cache at the time of backup. E.g., `1.5 GB`.    |
| **Shards**      | Number of shards included in the backup (relevant for cluster mode enabled). |

| Backup Name | Backup Type | Status | Cache Size | Shards |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| *(None)*    | -           | -      | -          | -      |

**Example Use Case:**
To enable point-in-time recovery, you can enable automated backups with a retention period (e.g., `7 days`) and ensure the backup window avoids peak traffic.

These features are critical for operational resilience and disaster recovery. Maintenance windows allow safe patching, and backups ensure recoverability in case of data loss.
