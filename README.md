# AWS ElastiCache Redis Upgrade – Testing Environment

## 1. Objective
Upgrade the existing **AWS ElastiCache Redis (Testing Environment)** from version **5.0.6** to **7.1**, ensuring compatibility, stability, and no data loss.  

This document outlines the **upgrade steps**, **configuration comparison**, and **validation plan**.

---

## 2. Upgrade Steps

### **Step 1: Take Backup**
- Create a **manual snapshot** of the current Redis cluster before upgrade.
- Verify snapshot is available and restorable.

> **AWS Console**:  
ElastiCache → Redis → Snapshots → Create Snapshot → Name: `pre-upgrade-testing-redis-YYYYMMDD`

---

### **Step 2: Prepare for Upgrade**
- Confirm target version `7.1` is supported.
- Check application/library compatibility with Redis 7.
- Review AWS documentation on [Supported Redis versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/supported-engine-versions.html).

---

### **Step 3: Modify Redis Cluster**
- Navigate to **ElastiCache → Redis → Modify Cluster**.
- Change **Engine Version** from `5.0.6` → `7.1`.
- A **new parameter group** (`default.redis7`) will be created automatically.
- Keep all other settings the same (see comparison table below).
- Select **Apply Immediately** (since this is test environment).

---

### **Step 4: Post-Upgrade Validation**
- Verify cluster is in `available` state.
- Confirm **parameter group** and **engine version** have updated.
- Run application smoke tests:
  - `PING`, `SET`, `GET` from Redis client.
  - Application connectivity check.
- Monitor CloudWatch metrics:
  - CPU, Memory, Replica Lag, CurrConnections.
- Review CloudWatch alarms for anomalies.

---

### **Step 5: Rollback Plan (If Needed)**
- Restore from the pre-upgrade snapshot:
  - Create a new cluster from the snapshot with Redis 5.0.6.
  - Update application endpoints to point to restored cluster.
- Note: In-place downgrade is **not supported**, rollback requires snapshot restore.

---

# To check all the Elasticache DB Indexes weather running or not in Cron.

<details>
  <summary>View the steps to check all the Elasticache DB Indexes weather running or not in Cron.</summary>

## 🔧 Steps

### 1. Install Redis CLI

Make sure your EC2/bastion/wherever the cron runs has `redis-cli` installed:

```bash
sudo yum install -y redis    # Amazon Linux / RHEL
# or
sudo apt-get install -y redis-tools  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

---

### 2. Create a Health Check Script

Create a script, e.g. `/usr/local/bin/check_redis_dbs.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check all Redis DB indexes and log result
# Usage: ./check_redis_dbs.sh

REDIS_HOST="your-redis-endpoint.amazonaws.com"
REDIS_PORT=6379
MAX_DB=15   # change if you have more DBs
LOG_FILE="/var/log/redis_db_health.log"

TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

echo "===== Redis DB Health Check at $TIMESTAMP =====" >> $LOG_FILE

for DB in $(seq 0 $MAX_DB); do
    # Try a PING on each DB
    RESPONSE=$(redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p $REDIS_PORT -n $DB PING 2>&1)

    if [ "$RESPONSE" == "PONG" ]; then
        echo "DB $DB: RUNNING" >> $LOG_FILE
    else
        echo "DB $DB: NOT RUNNING ($RESPONSE)" >> $LOG_FILE
    fi
done

echo "" >> $LOG_FILE
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check_redis_dbs.sh
```

---

### 3. Add Cron Job

Edit cron with:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to run every 5 minutes during upgrade (adjust as needed):

```bash
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/check_redis_dbs.sh
```

---

### 4. View Logs

All results will go into:

```
/var/log/redis_db_health.log
```

Sample log:

```
===== Redis DB Health Check at 2025-08-26 11:00:00 =====
DB 0: RUNNING
DB 1: RUNNING
DB 2: NOT RUNNING (Error: Connection reset by peer)
...
```

---

### 5. Stop the running cron

<details>
  <summary>Click to view the steps to stop the cron</summary>

## 5.1. Stop the cron schedule (prevent future runs)

Edit the cron table:

```bash
crontab -e
```

* Find the line:

  ```bash
  */1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/check_redis_dbs.sh
  ```
* Delete it (or comment it out with `#`).
* Save and exit.

This stops **new cron runs** from being scheduled.

---

## 5.2. Kill the currently running cron process (if the script is still running)

First, find the process:

```bash
ps -ef | grep check_redis_dbs.sh
```

Example output:

```
root   12345  1  0 10:02 ?  00:00:00 /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/check_redis_dbs.sh
```

Kill it:

```bash
kill -9 12345
```

---

## 5.3. Stop all cron jobs (not usually recommended)

If you want to **stop the cron daemon completely**:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop crond   # Amazon Linux / RHEL
sudo systemctl stop cron    # Ubuntu/Debian
```

To disable auto-start at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable crond
```

---

For the case (just stopping the Redis health check job):

* Remove the line from `crontab -e`
* And kill the process if one is currently running.

## 4. Configuration Parameters

| Variable         | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `REDIS_HOST`     | Redis cluster/instance hostname           |
| `REDIS_PORT`     | Redis port (default: 6379)                |
| `RUN_DURATION`   | How long to check in each cycle (seconds) |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL` | Interval between checks (seconds)         |
| `BREAK_DURATION` | Pause time after each cycle (seconds)     |
| `CYCLES`         | Number of cycles to repeat                |

---

## 5. Log Files

* **Success Log:**
  `/root/redis-health/redis_success.log`
  Format:

  ```
  2025-08-27 07:35:01 SUCCESS 1
  2025-08-27 07:36:01 SUCCESS 2
  === Cycle 1 completed, sleeping for 300 seconds ===
  ```

* **Error Log:**
  `/root/redis-health/redis_error.log`
  Format:

  ```
  2025-08-27 07:37:10 FAILURE: Could not connect to Redis
  ```

---

## 6. Run Manually

```bash
cd /root/redis-health
nohup sh redis_health.sh > redis_health.out 2>&1 &
```

* Runs in background
* Output stored in `redis_health.out`
* Logs saved in `redis_success.log` and `redis_error.log`

---

## 7. Run with Cron
To run manually
- Want the script `redis_health.sh` (located in `/root/redis-health/`) to keep running **even after closing the SSH session**, It should start it with `nohup` like this:

```bash
cd /root/redis-health
nohup sh redis_health.sh > redis_health.out 2>&1 &
```

* `nohup` → prevents the process from being killed when SSH closes.
* `> redis_health.out 2>&1` → redirects both standard output and errors to a file (`redis_health.out`).
* `&` → puts it in the background.

---

To run automatically every hour:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add:

```cron
0 * * * * /root/redis-health/redis_health.sh
```

---

## 8. Example Run Cycle (with default settings)

* Check every **60 seconds**
* Run continuously for **5 minutes**
* Take a **5 minute break**
* Repeat **4 times**

Total run time = (5 min check + 5 min break) × 4 = **40 minutes**

---

✅ With this setup:

* You have **continuous monitoring with controlled cycles**
* Logs are **timestamped** for easy troubleshooting
* Can be run **manually** or via **cron automation**

# Redis Health Check Script – Read/Write Test (No Leftover Keys) --> No Replica or No Multi-AZ, Just Single Node

<details>
  <summary>Click to view the steps</summary>

## Script Overview

**Filename:** `redis_health_rw_check.sh`
**Purpose:** Monitors Redis availability by performing temporary read/write operations. Tracks successes and failures without leaving any keys behind.

**Key Features:**

* Performs **temporary SET and GET** operations to confirm full read/write functionality.
* **Deletes temporary keys immediately** after each check.
* Logs **successes** and **errors** separately.
* Customizable **check interval**, **total run duration**, and **number of cycles**.

---

## Execution

### 1. Ensure script is executable

```bash
chmod +x /root/redis-health/redis_health_rw_check.sh
```

### 2. Run the script in background using `nohup`

```bash
nohup bash /root/redis-health/redis_health_rw_check.sh > /root/redis-health/redis_health_rw.out 2>&1 &
```

* `nohup` ensures the script keeps running even if the terminal is closed.
* Output and errors will be captured in `/root/redis-health/redis_health_rw.out`.

### 3. Monitor logs

* **Success log:** `/root/redis-health/redis_success.log`

  * Shows timestamped successes with counter: `SUCCESS 1, SUCCESS 2 ...`
* **Error log:** `/root/redis-health/redis_error.log`

  * Shows timestamped failures if Redis is unresponsive or read/write fails.

### 4. Optional: Run via cron

To run the script **once every hour**:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the line:

```bash
0 * * * * /root/redis-health/redis_health_rw_check.sh
```

---

## How It Works

1. Each loop generates a **temporary key** (`healthcheck_<random>`).
2. Performs a **SET** and then a **GET**.
3. Immediately deletes the temporary key to avoid polluting Redis.
4. Logs **successes** and **failures** with timestamps.
5. Repeats for the specified **RUN\_DURATION** and **CYCLES**.

✅ This ensures **full read/write validation** without leaving any keys behind.

---

## Notes / Best Practices

* Adjust `CHECK_INTERVAL` to detect shorter downtime periods.
* Use **primary Redis endpoint** for read/write validation.
* Review logs periodically to detect any transient failures.
* For long-running monitoring, combine with `logrotate` to prevent log files from growing too large.

Perfect! That’s exactly how you can measure downtime in a single-node ElastiCache setup with auto-failover. Here’s the sequence and what to expect:

---

### 1️⃣ Before upgrade

* Start your **read/write monitoring script** (the one with temporary keys).
* It continuously logs `SUCCESS` in normal operation.

### 2️⃣ During upgrade

* AWS will **replace the node** with the new Redis version.
* There will likely be a **few seconds of downtime**:

  * SET/GET may fail temporarily → these failures get logged in `redis_error.log`.
  * This is exactly the period your script captures as “downtime.”

### 3️⃣ After upgrade

* Once the node is back and healthy:

  * SET/GET will succeed again → logged as `SUCCESS`.
  * Your script will show the exact duration of downtime in your logs (number of failed checks × `CHECK_INTERVAL`).

### 4️⃣ Notes

* With **auto-failover enabled**, if the node had a replica, AWS would promote it temporarily to reduce downtime. But since you have **single-node**, the downtime is for the **whole duration of the upgrade**.
* The **temporary keys** in your script ensure no leftover keys in Redis.

---

✅ **Tip:**

* Keep `CHECK_INTERVAL` small (5–10 seconds) for precise downtime measurement.
* Monitor both `redis_success.log` and `redis_error.log` during upgrade.

## Redis Zero Downtime Version Upgrade and Node Replacement or Failover

**Complete playbook** of **every proven technique** (beyond the Blue-Green + `SLAVEOF` pattern) that big companies use to **achieve true zero-downtime major version upgrades** in **AWS ElastiCache for Redis**.

## TL;DR – All Zero-Downtime Paths

| Method | Zero Downtime? | Automation Level | Best For |
|-------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| **1. ElastiCache Serverless Auto-Upgrade** | Yes | Built-in | New apps, auto-scaling |
| **2. In-Place Upgrade + Multi-AZ (AWS)** | ~5s write pause | Built-in | Simple clusters |
| **3. Blue-Green + Live Replication** | Yes | Manual/Automated | Full control |
| **4. Global Datastore + Cross-Region Sync** | Yes | Semi-automated | DR + upgrade |
| **5. Dual-Write + Read Shadowing** | Yes | App-level | Maximum safety |
| **6. Proxy-Based Traffic Shifting (Envoy/HAProxy)** | Yes | High | Microservices |
| **7. RedisShake / Slot Migration (Cluster Mode)** | Yes | Tool-based | Sharded clusters |
| **8. Canary Deploy with Application Routers** | Yes | App-level | Gradual rollout |

## 1. **ElastiCache Serverless (True Zero Downtime – Built-In)**

> **Best for new apps or migration**

```bash
# Just change the version
aws elasticache modify-cache-cluster \
  --cache-cluster-id my-redis-serverless \
  --engine-version 7.1 \
  --apply-immediately
```

- **AWS handles**: New nodes, live sync, atomic switch
- **Downtime**: **0 seconds**
- **SLA**: 99.99%
- **Limitation**: No fine-grained control

**Use if**: You're okay with serverless abstraction.

---

## 2. **In-Place Upgrade with Multi-AZ (AWS Native – Minimal Downtime)**

```bash
aws elasticache modify-replication-group \
  --replication-group-id mycluster \
  --engine-version 7.1 \
  --apply-immediately
```

| Phase | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Reads | Always available |
| Writes | **~3–8 sec pause** during failover |
| Failover | Auto, Multi-AZ |

**Not zero**, but **feels zero** with:
- Client retries (exponential backoff)
- Connection pooling
- Scheduled in low-traffic window

**Use if**: You accept <10s blip

---

## 3. **Blue-Green + Live Replication (Already Covered)**

**See previous answer** – gold standard for node-based clusters.

---

## 4. **Global Datastore + Cross-Region Replication**

> **Upgrade one region, sync live, switch traffic**

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[US-East-1 v6.2] -->|Global Datastore| B[US-West-2 v7.1]
  B -->|Promote| C[Primary]
```

### Steps:
1. Create **Global Datastore** with v6.2 (primary) + v7.1 (secondary)
2. Wait for **active-active sync** (lag < 100ms)
3. **Remove primary region** → v7.1 becomes primary
4. Update **Route 53 latency routing** to new region

**Zero downtime** | **Cross-region DR bonus**

**Use if**: You have multi-region app

---

## 5. **Dual-Write + Read Shadowing (App-Level Safety)**

> **Write to both old & new clusters during transition**

```python
# Pseudocode
def set(key, value):
    blue.redis.set(key, value)   # old
    green.redis.set(key, value)  # new

def get(key):
    value = green.redis.get(key)  # read from new
    if value is None:
        return blue.redis.get(key)  # fallback
    return value
```

### Rollout:
1. Deploy app with **dual-write**
2. Sync green via `SLAVEOF` or backup/restore
3. **Cut reads** to green
4. **Stop writes** to blue
5. **Delete blue**

**100% safe** – no data divergence

**Use if**: Data integrity > speed

---

## 6. **Proxy Layer: Envoy / HAProxy / AWS ALB**

> **Smart proxy routes traffic without app changes**

```yaml
# Envoy config
- name: redis_proxy
  clusters:
    - name: redis_blue
      endpoints: [blue.cluster.amazonaws.com:6379]
    - name: redis_green
      endpoints: [green.cluster.amazonaws.com:6379]
  routes:
    - match: { prefix: "/" }
      route: { cluster: redis_green }  # atomic switch
```

### Switch:
```bash
kubectl apply -f envoy-green.yaml  # 0ms downtime
```

**Use if**: Microservices, Kubernetes, no app changes

---

## 7. **RedisShake (Alibaba) – For Cluster Mode Enabled**

> **Live slot-by-slot migration** (like `CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`)

```bash
# reddis-shake.toml
[type]
sync = true

[source]
address = blue.cluster:6379
password = xxx

[target]
address = green.cluster:6379
password = xxx

[advanced]
parallel = 16
```

```bash
./redis-shake -type sync -conf reddis-shake.toml
```

- Migrates **keys in real-time**
- Supports **sharded clusters**
- **Zero downtime**

**Use if**: Cluster mode enabled, >10 shards

---

## 8. **Canary Deploy with Application Router**

> **Gradual traffic shift**

```yaml
# Argo Rollouts
- canary:
    steps:
    - setWeight: 10  # 10% to green
    - pause: {duration: 5m}
    - setWeight: 50
    - pause: {duration: 10m}
    - setWeight: 100
```

**Use if**: You want to monitor errors before full switch

---

## Decision Matrix: Which Method to Pick?

| Scenario | Recommended Method |
|--------|-------------------|
| New app, no legacy | **Serverless Auto-Upgrade** |
| Small cluster, <10s OK | **In-Place Multi-AZ** |
| Full control, node-based | **Blue-Green + SLAVEOF** |
| Multi-region | **Global Datastore** |
| Data safety critical | **Dual-Write + Shadow** |
| Kubernetes | **Envoy Proxy Switch** |
| Sharded (Cluster Mode) | **RedisShake** |
| Gradual rollout | **Canary + Argo** |

## Final Checklist (Before Upgrade)

- [ ] Backup (snapshot) enabled
- [ ] Multi-AZ enabled
- [ ] Parameter group compatible with new version
- [ ] Client retry logic (exponential backoff)
- [ ] Monitoring: `ReplicationLag`, `CPUUtilization`
- [ ] Rollback plan (keep old cluster 1hr)
- [ ] Test in staging first

---

### Bottom Line:
> **True zero-downtime is possible** — **pick one method above**, **automate it**, and **never take downtime again**.

Start with **Serverless** if greenfield.  
Use **Blue-Green + RedisShake** for maximum control.

You now have **8 battle-tested paths** to **zero-downtime Redis upgrades**.
